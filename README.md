🖼️ Text-to-Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion

This project focuses on generating high-quality images from natural language prompts using Stable Diffusion XL. It allows users to input any descriptive text, and the model synthesizes a realistic image based on the description. The implementation is done using Google Colab with GPU acceleration and the diffusers library by Hugging Face.
